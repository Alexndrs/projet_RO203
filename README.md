# ENSTA PARIS : Project RO203 - Operation Search/Optimization

## Overview

This project was conducted as part of the RO203 course, focusing on operation search and optimization using Julia. The main objectives were to apply theoretical knowledge from the course to practical problems and to learn Julia from scratch.
The final french report is more exhaustive and precise and can be found (here)[Rapport_RO203.pdf] 

## Project Description

The project consisted of solving two optimization games using LaTeX for documentation and Julia for implementation:

### 1. Rectangles Game

- **Objective**: Solve a grid by placing non-overlapping rectangles.
- **Method**: Formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem.
- **Skills Acquired**:
  - MILP formulation and constraints.
  - Grid generation and validation.
  - Implementing and solving optimization problems in Julia.

### 2. Singles Game

- **Objective**: Color a grid with constraints to minimize black cells while ensuring connectivity.
- **Method**: Formulated and solved using both MILP and heuristic methods.
- **Skills Acquired**:
  - Advanced MILP formulation with complex constraints.
  - Heuristic problem-solving techniques.
  - Comparing optimization methods and analyzing performance.

## What I Learned

- **Julia Programming**: I learned Julia from scratch, which was essential for implementing the optimization algorithms.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Gained hands-on experience with MILP and heuristic methods to solve complex optimization problems.
- **Problem-Solving**: Developed strategies for grid generation and constraint satisfaction, ensuring feasible and optimized solutions.

## Skills Acquired

- **Programming in Julia**: Including syntax, data structures, and libraries for mathematical optimization.
- **Formulating Optimization Problems**: Translating real-world problems into mathematical models.
- **Algorithm Development**: Creating efficient algorithms to generate and solve optimization problems.
- **LaTeX for Documentation**: Using LaTeX to document and present the project professionally.
